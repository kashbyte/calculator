# 🧮 Simple Calculator (Python)

A command line based Python calculator developed during the early stages of my programming journey. This project performs basic arithmetic operations using user input and demonstrates my foundational understanding of Python functions, conditional logic, and program flow.

---

## ✨ Features

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Separate functions for each arithmetic operation
* Simple and intuitive command line interaction
* Clean and readable code structure

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries required

---

## 🚀 How to Start

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Save the script as `calculator.py`
3. Open a terminal or command prompt
4. Navigate to the file location
5. Run the program using:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

---

## ▶️ How to Use

When the program runs, you will be prompted to:

1. Enter the first number
2. Enter the second number
3. Enter the arithmetic operation to perform

Supported operations:

* `+` for addition
* `-` for subtraction
* `*` for multiplication
* `/` for division

Example usage:

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter the operation: *
50
```

If an unsupported operator is entered, the program will display an error message indicating invalid input.

## 📚 What This Project Teaches

* Structuring programs using functions
* Passing arguments between functions
* Applying conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
* Handling user input and output through the terminal

---

## 💡 Possible Improvements

* Add input validation for non numeric values
* Handle division by zero safely
* Extend functionality with additional operations
* Implement a loop to allow continuous calculations

## 🧠 Notes

This project represents an early milestone in my programming journey. Revisiting and refining its documentation reflects my growth from writing basic scripts to developing more structured and maintainable software solutions.

Happy coding 🚀
